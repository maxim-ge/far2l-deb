Quick way to get far2l running on windows (for example, to use remote far2l via netrocks with all features like clipboard sync
and full keyboard support; 64 bits only for now):

1. Setup cygwin as follows:
setup-x86_64.exe -P libglib2.0_0,libneon27,libnfs8,libssh-common,libwx_baseu3.0_0,libwx_gtk3u3.0_0,xinit,xlaunch,xorg-server,libssh4,wget
2. Open cygwin shell
3. Install far2l:
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unxed/far2l-deb/master/get_cyg_far2l_64.sh | bash
4. Run far2l just as "far2l"

If you have problems with keyboard layout switching, add something like
XKBLAYOUT us,ru
XkbOptions grp:alt_shift_toggle
to .XWinrc file in your cygwin home folder (you may need to create that file if not exists).
